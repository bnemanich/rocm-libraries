"""Pin the per-mmak interleave restructure of the subtile tail scaffold.

The historic scaffold allocated every A/B mma vgprTile up front and
emitted LR for the whole grid before the per-mmak MFMA loop, which
held ~184 VGPRs live across mmak on MT320x288x64 BF16 and blew the
wave-64 256-VGPR budget. The restructure (this commit) interleaves
the slice alloc + ds_read + MFMA grid per mmak so peak pressure
tracks one slice (~92 VGPRs for the same MT).

This file pins three invariants of the restructure:

1. The tail body emits `ds_read` per mmak iteration (not once up
   front for every mmak's worth of slices).
2. The emit-time `vgprPool.size()` is identical before and after
   the scaffold runs (no slice leak; the per-mmak alloc/free is
   matched).
3. The aligned-K hot path (`NoTailLoop=True`) is byte-identical to
   before: no `ds_read` for A/B is emitted at all.
